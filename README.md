# Instructions

### Documentation
Check [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Altruistic/Schoolnika/1.0.0) for documentation purpose.

### Note
1. User blog posts are automatically fetched together with user. This is done to prevent multiple calls to the server.

2. Due to the restriction in same **route** naming in swagger API, I had to use different **id** name on for the documenatation. It is just **id** in the codebase.

3. Kindly put token generated for logged-in user in the **Authorize** modal to access protected routes. Click the **Authorize** button at the top-right corner to see the modal.

4. Insert values (integers) in the **skip** and **limit** parameters of the **fetch all blog posts** endpoint to **paginate**.
