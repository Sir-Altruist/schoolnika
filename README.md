# Instructions

### Documentation
Check [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Altruistic/Schoolnika/1.0.0) for documentation purpose.

### Note
1. User blog posts are automatically fetched together with user. This is done to prevent multiple calls to the server.

2. Due to the restriction in same **route** naming in swagger API, I had to use different **id** name on for the documenatation. It is just **id** in the codebase.

3. Kindly put token generated for logged-in user in the **Authorize** modal at the top in order to access protected routes.
